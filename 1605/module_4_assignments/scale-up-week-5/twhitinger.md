# Scale Up Submission Form

## Basics

### Summarize the work you completed over the last two weeks
Configure EsLinter because jshint is no longer supported. Debug axios gem for rails and  pulled dist files into rails project. Configure rails to work with react frontend. CRUD out application to allow react compononet to send get and post requests. Re-did react tutorial translating to ES6 syntax. Copious amount of time spent reading react docs and testing solutions in codepen. Research best resources for learning most common interview questions and how to solve them in javascript. Wrote blog about solving common questions about counting unique values with hashes and implmenting a trie using ES6 classes. Research job in locations that interest me.

### Discuss: your experience doing blog reviews and getting feedback (links are nice)
my feedback: 
Hi Matt, really love the layout of your blog and the use of links for any word or phrase that the user may be unsure of. I think your blog organization is excellent and your ideas are delivered concisely. As far as room for improvement my only recommendation would be to have a few sentences that delivered the "why this matters" to the reader.  Perhaps a little more in depth  about why the reader should follow the pattern you outlined, or how you would have structured your plan to learn swift now that today after you  learned all these lessons/struggles with learning something brand new over several days. Otherwise really well thought out and easy to read!

Zach read through your blog.  A couple of ideas that may be useful. Since this is a first person anecdotal, I think it would be useful to change the  instructions to address the reader directly instead of using "one could do this" to portray more authority I like to stick with 'you' when I address the reader. Additionally maybe take a few sentences to say why the following steps are the best to follow based on your experience and the troubles you experienced when you tackled the project blind the first time "I put together these instructions because all shit went to hell when I dived in blind" .  Also think about the ideal order you think would work best, maybe before tackling a brown project what could be some ideal prework someone could do even before reading readmes or the code that would bring them up to speed, maybe that would be a best first step.

### Discuss: your experience doing daily stand ups
pretty straight forward, I delivered some riveting feedback.
